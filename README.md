5. **Press F5** to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window

### Usage

#### Starting a Session
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Start Coding Buddy Session"
3. Click the command to begin

#### Camera Control
- **Toggle Camera**: Use the command "Toggle Camera" to turn webcam on/off
- **Status Bar**: Click the status bar item to see current status and options

#### Commands Available
- `coding-buddy-bot.startSession` - Start a new coding session
- `coding-buddy-bot.stopSession` - End the current session
- `coding-buddy-bot.toggleCamera` - Turn camera on/off

## üîß Configuration

### Camera Permissions
The extension requires webcam access to function. Make sure to:
- Allow camera permissions when prompted
- Ensure your webcam is working and accessible
- Check that no other applications are using the camera

### Health Reminder Timing
Health reminders are automatically scheduled:
- **Stretches**: Every 20-30 minutes
- **Water**: Every 45 minutes
- **Posture**: Every 35 minutes
- **Eye Care**: Every 40 minutes
- **Micro-breaks**: Every hour

## üé≠ How It Works

### Emotion Detection
The extension uses computer vision to detect:
- **Focused/Concentrated**: Deep thinking and problem-solving
- **Happy/Confident**: Successful moments and understanding
- **Frustrated/Confused**: When you're working through challenges
- **Surprised**: Discovery and "aha!" moments

### Motivational Feedback
Based on detected emotions, the bot provides:
- **Encouragement** during challenging moments
- **Celebration** of breakthroughs and successes
- **Support** for maintaining focus and productivity
- **Recognition** of your growth and progress

### Health Monitoring
The health system tracks:
- **Physical activity** through stretch reminders
- **Hydration** with water break suggestions
- **Posture** maintenance for long-term health
- **Eye care** to prevent digital eye strain

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Main Extension** (`extension.ts`): Orchestrates all components
- **CodingBuddyBot** (`codingBuddyBot.ts`): Core bot logic and session management
- **EmotionDetector** (`emotionDetector.ts`): Computer vision and emotion recognition
- **MotivationalFeedback** (`motivationalFeedback.ts`): Context-aware encouragement system
